# ✅ Travel Agents Setup - Fixed and Working

## Problem Solved
- **Issue**: The original `bun run create-agents` command was failing with a 405 "Method Not Allowed" error
- **Root Cause**: ElevenLabs doesn't support programmatic agent creation via API - agents must be created through their dashboard
- **Solution**: Updated the system to provide step-by-step manual setup instructions instead

## ✅ Current Status: WORKING

All commands are now functioning correctly:

### 1. `bun run create-agents` ✅
```bash
bun run create-agents
```
**What it does now:**
- Validates all agent configurations 
- Provides clear step-by-step instructions for manual agent creation
- Creates a template configuration file (`.travel-agents-config.json`)
- Shows detailed information for each of the 6 travel agents

### 2. `bun run test-agents` ✅  
```bash
bun run test-agents
```
**What it does:**
- Checks if agent IDs have been configured properly
- Detects template IDs that need replacement
- Validates configuration structure
- Shows agent status and capabilities

### 3. `bun run travel-agents list` ✅
```bash
bun run travel-agents list
```
**What it does:**
- Lists all 6 available travel agents
- Shows their descriptions and capabilities
- Displays agent keys for reference

### 4. `bun run travel-agents export` ✅
```bash
bun run travel-agents export
```
**What it does:**
- Exports detailed agent configurations
- Creates `agent-configs-export.json` with full setup details
- Useful for manual agent creation reference
